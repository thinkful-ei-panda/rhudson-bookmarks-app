# Bookmarks App

## Rebecca Hudson

### Overview

The bookmark app allows you to save your favorite websites as bookmarks along with a star rating, description and a link to the website. The rating can be filtered once bookmarks are added.

### User Stories

As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. 

Bookmarks contain:
- title
- url link
- description
- rating (1-5)
- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
